1. How does client and server communicate? Explain why DNS is required?

When a Client device wants to access the Wedpage a copy of the web page is downloaded from the server onto the client machine to be displayed in the user browser.

In order for the client to communicate with the server, it needs to know the unique address of the server, the address is called the internet protocol address or for short I.P Address

DNS = Domain Name Server is required to go to web pages mostly, such as “www.google.com”. On the back end as soon as you hit enter in the browser, the request will go to one of the ins server which could be on computer or it could be in internet server provider. DNS does not require IP address to be access, but instead the Domain Name Server.

2. WWW = world wide web

3.URL = Unique Resource Locator or Uniform Resource Locator

4. Protocol = an agreement between two communicating parties. And have to agree on a common form of exchange or a common note of communication.

5. .com is the extension of the domain name examples: .edu, .au, .mx

6. How to determine the IP address go to command propmt and type in "ipconfig" and it will give you the IP Address or Internet Protocol Address.
